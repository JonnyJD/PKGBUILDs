PKGBUILDs for the AUR
=====================

These are `PKGBUILD`_\ s for the Arch User Repository (`AUR`_).
The AUR hosts user supplied source package definitons for `Arch Linux`_.

Starting with `AUR 4`_ every package is in a separate git repository.
These are only included as submodules here.
The packages I maintain are listed here:
`Packages by JonnyJD <https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/?SeB=m&K=JonnyJD>`_

There are no GitHub clones of the submodules.
Please report issues and link patches (`git format-patch`)
in the package comments at the AUR.

In `_bin`_ you can find scripts to manage AUR 4 packages
as submodules.
